    Initialization of the snake, before starting to play: Setting the default values

    - We set values to the snake head, and its body
    - The init value of the y-axis is 9, constantly for the whole snakeBody
    - The init value of the x-axis starts at 24, but increases up to the value 30

    - We also set its default direction and player score to 0 ----> Which is used for generating apples and later display score to currentUser

    - Snake.h ----> We have created a struct Snake to handle different values/properties of the snake:
                        * Direction
                        * x- and y- coordinate values
